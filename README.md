# oaDOI-LibGuides-Widget
Code for creating an oaDOI widget in LibGuides 2.0.

Simply paste the code into a Rich Text/HTML box after replacing the placeholder text on line 18 with a valid email address. The widget leverages the fact that LibGuides 2.0 is built over Bootstrap, so there shouldn't be anything you else that needs to be done.
